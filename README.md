# Climate Care

### Introcuction

Welcome to Climate Care! This is a web application for merging
the topics of sustainability and gamification on University campuses,
hopefully encouraging you to take care of your local environment better,
while having fun in the process!

Our web app will allow you to take care of a virtual pet who we like to
call Climate Kitty, or simply Kitty for short. In the process of looking 
after your Kitty, you'll  also be encouraged to reduce, reuse, and recycle
your waste!

### Premise

Looking after a pet is no easy task, and Climate Kitty is no different.

Your Kitty will need three things from you:
- Water
- Food
- Cleaning

In order to provide these three things for your Kitty, you'll need to
engage in sustainable activities:
- Refilling a water bottle instead of using disposable plastic
  - This hydrates your Kitty
- Recycling waste at designated recycling points
  - This feeds your Kitty
- Viewing articles that raise awareness for the ongoing climate emergency
  - This cleans your Kitty's litter box

Over time, your overall positive impact on the climate will grow 
larger and larger with every plastic water bottle not bought, and
with every can recycled instead of thrown away. We'll track this
for you, and show you your net impact as you play the game.

### How to Play

The first thing you'll need in order to play Climate Care (aside from
a mobile phone) is an account.

If you're playing the game locally, you'll need to follow the following
steps:
1. Open your machine's terminal
   - on windows, click the windows buttom on the bottom-left of your screen and search for `cmd`
   - on MacOS, press the search icon on the top-right of your screen and search for `terminal.app`
   - on Linux, navigate to the dash bar on the left and click the `Show Applications` button. from there, search for `terminal`.
2. Navigate to the `C:/path/to/our/game/ClimateCare/climate_care` directory
